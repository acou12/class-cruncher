# Class Cruncher

A desktop app for optimizing school schedules.

## Demos

![A demo of the schedule builder using the "last time" heuristic.](/demos/last-time.png)
![A demo of the schedule builder; two breaks (lunch and cpc) are selected.](/demos/gaps-breaks.png)
![A demo of the schedule builder with the "credit hours" setting set to 30.](/demos/super-schedules.png)
![A fullscreen view of a schedule.](/demos/fullscreen.png)
![A fullscreen view of a super schedule (48 credit hours).](/demos/super-schedule-full.png)

## Ideas

- Evolutionary algorithm for optimization
- "Optional" and "Required" classes
- Schedule codes for easy sharing
- Walking distance heuristic
  - https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/distance-matrix/overview
- Hueristic "preferences" -- werightedly combine multiple heuristics to get the total "fitness" of a schedule
- Collaborative schedule making
  - Using [PeerJS](https://peerjs.com/)
- Draggable section editor
- Add extra preferrable locations in between classes
  - e.g.,
    - "I want to be near the dining facility at lunch time."
    - "I want my first/last class to be near my dorm."
- Crowdsourcing?

## Running
